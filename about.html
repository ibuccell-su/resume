        <br> <br>

               I am a recent graduate of Syracuse University with a degree in Information Technology & Management and a concentration in Front-End Web Development and Information Project Management. <br>  <br>

My interest in the world of information technology began my freshman year of college when I was compelled to work in an environment that embraces digital innovation and is at the forefront of implementing the latest technology trends. <br>  <br>

Additionally, I recognize the significance of a female leader in IT, which is seemingly dominated by men. Through my courses and internships this fact has become clearer, yet it is also a source of my motivation. <br>  <br>

Syracuse University has introduced me to a well-known group known as Girls Who Code. This program ultimately gives women the opportunity to not only begin to grasp the foundations of coding languages, but also encourage and welcome girls into the world of technology by showing them their potential and what other inspiring women have done. <br>  <br>

With Syracuse University’s Girls Who Code group, we are unique. Our team travels twice a week to our local refugee center to work with local middle and high school girls. What is challenging is our cultural and language barriers, however, it has taught me to overcome adversity. We have created our own personal curriculum that leans on visual learning. <br>  <br>

This has been the most rewarding part of my undergraduate career. Inspired by what I study, the positions I’ve held, and the people I work with I hope to secure a position, in my postgraduate career, at a fast-paced, diverse, and innovative company. <br>  <br>

I am eager to join and add value to the corporate world, while continuing to grow my skillset and inspiration.</div>  <br>  <br>
